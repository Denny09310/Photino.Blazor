# Photino.Blazor Project Update (19/04/2024) 🚀
>Apologies for reaching out here, but I couldn't find an open discussion section in the Photino.Blazor repository.

I wanted to share some modifications I'm considering for the Photino.Blazor library after re-evaluating its potential.

These updates serve as a heads-up for the authors of the library and their contributors. Since writing, debugging, and testing code is time-consuming, I value your opinion before proceeding further. I want to ensure that the effort I put in aligns with the project's direction and doesn't end up being futile.
